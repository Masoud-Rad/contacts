## Overview

The Contacts App is designed to help users store and organize their contacts. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing contacts, including the ability to add, edit, and delete contacts. The app supports search functionality, allowing users to quickly find specific contacts by name. It is built using .NET MAUI, a framework for building native multi-platform apps with a single codebase.

## Functionality

The Contacts App offers the following features:

- **Home Page**: The home page serves as the main entry point for the app. It includes a search bar, a list of all contacts, and a button to add a new contact.
- **Contact Details Page**: Tapping on a contact in the list navigates the user to a single contact page, where all the contact's information is displayed.
- **Edit Contact**: The single contact page includes an edit button, allowing users to modify the contact's information.
- **Delete Contact**: Each contact in the list has a delete option, allowing users to remove unwanted contacts.
- **Search**: The search bar enables users to search for contacts by name, providing instant search results as they type.

## Technologies Used

The Contacts App is built using the following technologies:

- **.NET MAUI**: A framework for building native multi-platform apps, allowing the app to run on Android, Windows, iOS, and Mac OS.
- **XAML**: A markup language used to define the user interface of the app.
- **C#**: The programming language used to implement the app's logic and functionality.

## Code Structure

The Contacts App codebase consists of two main files:

- **ContactsPage.xaml**: This XAML file defines the structure and layout of the home page. It includes a search bar, a list view for displaying contacts, and an "Add" button.
- **ContactsPage.xaml.cs**: This C# file contains the code-behind for the home page. It includes event handlers for various interactions, such as item selection, item tapping, button clicks, and search bar text changes. It also handles navigation to other pages and manages the loading and manipulation of contacts.

## Getting Started

2. Open the solution in an IDE or text editor that supports .NET MAUI development.
3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.
4. Ensure you have the necessary SDKs and emulators installed for your target platforms (Android, Windows, iOS, Mac OS).
5. Run the app on your desired platform or emulator to see it in action.
